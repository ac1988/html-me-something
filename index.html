                    <h3>The beautiful beach</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have visited Florida many times.  I lived in Orlando 
                        and my parents currently live just outside of Daytona Beach.  
                        This was the first time that I have had the pleasure of
                        visiting a beach on the Gulf side.  The sand was so clean
                        that it squeaked when you walked on it.  The water was such
                        a beautiful shade of blue.  This was unlike any beach that 
                        I have experienced in the past and I can't wait to go back
                        one day!
                    </p>

                        <h3>Dining at Barefoot Grill</h3>
                        <p>
                            This restaurant was perfect in every way.  It was located right on
                            the beach, it had amazing food &amp; drinks, and it even had a kiddie 
                            pool to keep my kids entertained so I could enjoy my meal for a change!

                            <h3>Cruising through the bay on a double decker pontoon</h3>
                            <p>
                                The third day that we were in Panama City Beach we rented a 
                                double decker pontoon and it was such a great way to experience
                                all that Panama City Beach had to offer.  While cruising through the
                                bay, we even got to see dolphins!  We also anchored the boat at Shell Island
                                where we were able to enjoy the two water slides off the back of the 
                                boat!

                                <h3>Enjoying margaritas</h3>
                                <p>
                                    You can't have a beach vacation without margaritas!  I was able to showcase
                                    some of my startending skills when making these delicious pineapple 
                                    cadillac margaritas.  Mix up a little 1800 Tequila, sour mix, pineapple juice,
                                    Grand Marnier, and blue curacao...squeeze in a lime and you have yourself
                                    a vaction-worthy cocktail!

                                    <h3>Seeing the smile on my kids' faces</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        I have an 11 year old son, a 2 1/2 year old girl, and a 10 month old girl.
                                        They all really enjoyed this vacation!  This was the first time at the beach 
                                        for the two girls.  My 2 1/2 year old was OBSESSED with playing in the sand! 
                                        Honestly, seeing these kids smile throughout this trip was probably the absolute
                                        best part for me!  Their happiness means the world to me!

                                        <p>
                                            Both of my brothers live here in St. Louis, but my parents live in Florida,
                                            so it is rare for all of us to get together at once.  This vacation was so
                                            special because we got to have some quality bonding time since we were all
                                            staying together in the condo off of the beach.  We had such a fabulous time
                                            just relaxing and enjoying eachother's company! 
                                        </p>
